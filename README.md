## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle AirBnB Data to better understand:

1. What does the monthly average price of available listings look like in Seattle?
2. How many listings are available by month in 2016?
3. Is there any relationship between the average price of the listings and the listingsâ€™ neighborhood?
4. Are there any other variables that have a strong relationship with the price of listings?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@dream777x/exploring-on-seattle-airbnb-data-58516b84d64c).
